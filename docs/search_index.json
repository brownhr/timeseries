This course offers methods and workflows for analyzing and interpreting time series data, an overview of when, why, and how to use time series data, and various utilities and packages in R that are beneficial to analysts. By the end of this course, students will have the skills to: Interpret and understand time series plots Import ts data to create and manipulate ts objects from the stats package Understand why time series data is fundamentally different than non-ts data.

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2022) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
