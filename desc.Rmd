Working with data that changes over time is an essential skill in data science; this kind of data is known as a time series! This course will guide you through the process of importing, exploring, and visualizing time series data in R, using the zoo and lubridate packages. You'll learn techniques such as interpolation, resampling, and creating rolling and expanding windows.

You'll work with a variety of datasets, from CO2 concentrations from the Mauna Loa observatory, to the stock market prices of several European stock markets. Following this course, you'll be able to visualize and interpret how your data changes over time!
