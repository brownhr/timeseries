# Introduction to time series data

## Lesson: What is Time Series Data

  - Learning Objective: Learner will be able to understand why and how TS-data differs from non-temporal data
  - LO: What kinds of inferences and results can be obtained from TS-data
  - LO: Converting to and from time-based data formats, such as `numeric`, `Date`, and `POSIXct` classes
    - Functions: `as.Date()`, `lubridate::`, etc.

## Lesson: How to Interpret Time Series Data

  - LO: Learner will understand how to interpret attributes of a basic time series plot
  - LO: "Signal and Noise" in the context of TS data
  - Introduction to Stationarity: Most real-world data are not stationary and require additional steps to work with
  
## Lesson: Components of Time Series Data
  <!-- - LO: Understand the  -->

<!-- Non-stationary time series are defined by: -->

<!-- - Time-dependent Mean -->
<!-- - Time-dependent Variance -->
<!-- - Time-dependent Autocorrelation/Covariance -->


<!-- ## Dickey-Fuller Test of Stationarity -->
